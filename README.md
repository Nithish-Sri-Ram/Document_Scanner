# Document_Scanner
This repository contains a Document Scanner project developed using C++ and leveraging the capabilities of the OpenCV library. This project was created as part of my computer science coursework during the 3rd semester. The Document Scanner utilizes OpenCV's imgcodecs.hpp, highgui.hpp, and imgproc.hpp libraries to provide a comprehensive solution for scanning documents.
## Project Overview
The Document Scanner project allows users to process images and extract documents by eliminating the extra noise in the background and only gives back the required image.
